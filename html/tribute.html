                        <p class="eskom">Johnny Depp is an American actor, producer, and musician, born on June 9, 1963, in Owensboro, Kentucky. He rose to fame in the 1980s with his role on the TV series 21 Jump Street and has since become one of the most popular actors of his generation.</p>
                        <p class="eskom">Depp has appeared in a wide range of films, from dramas to comedies to action movies, and has worked with some of the most respected directors in the industry, such as Tim Burton, Martin Scorsese, and Terry Gilliam.</p>
                        <p class="eskom">Some of his most notable roles include Captain Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, Edward Scissorhands, and the Mad Hatter in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. He has been nominated for three Academy Awards and has won a Golden Globe Award for his role in Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.</p>
                        <p class="eskom">In recent years, Depp has been involved in several high-profile legal battles, including a lawsuit against his former business managers and a libel case against a British tabloid that labeled him a "wife-beater." Despite these controversies, he remains a beloved figure in Hollywood and has a dedicated fanbase around the world.</p>
